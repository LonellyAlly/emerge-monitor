## ‚ú® Features

- **üìä Real-time Emerge Monitoring**: Track your emerge progress with ETA estimates using `genlop`
- **üé® Multiple Screensavers**: Cycle through various CLI screensavers (pipes.sh, cmatrix, hollywood, asciiquarium)
- **‚è∞ Time Tracking**: Monitor script runtime and emerge process duration
- **üîÑ Auto/Manual Refresh**: Choose between automatic or manual screen updates
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Refresh Rate**: Adjust refresh intervals on-the-fly
- **üéØ Simple Controls**: Easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts
- **üé≠ Beautiful Interface**: Color-coded terminal UI with clean formatting

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies

- **Gentoo Linux** (obviously!)
- **bash** (version 5.0 or higher)
- **genlop** - For emerge progress tracking
  ```bash
  sudo emerge app-portage/genlop
  ```
- **sudo** - Script requires sudo access to run genlop

### Optional Dependencies (Screensavers)

Install any or all of these for the full screensaver experience:

```bash
# pipes.sh - Animated pipes
sudo emerge app-misc/pipes

# cmatrix - Matrix-style falling characters
sudo emerge app-misc/cmatrix

# hollywood - Hollywood-style hacker terminal
sudo emerge app-misc/hollywood

# asciiquarium - ASCII aquarium
sudo emerge games-misc/asciiquarium
```

**Note**: The script will work without these screensavers, but you'll only have the "none" option available.

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Download the script**:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/emerge-monitor/main/emerge-monitor.sh
   ```

2. **Make it executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x emerge-monitor.sh
   ```

3. **Optional: Move to a system path**:
   ```bash
   sudo mv emerge-monitor.sh /usr/local/bin/emerge-monitor
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the script while an emerge process is active:

```bash
./emerge-monitor.sh
```

Or if installed system-wide:

```bash
emerge-monitor
```

### Running Without Emerge

You can run the script even without an active emerge process. It will display "No emerge process currently running" but all other features will work.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **s** | Toggle Screensaver | Cycles through screensavers: none ‚Üí pipes.sh ‚Üí cmatrix ‚Üí hollywood ‚Üí asciiquarium ‚Üí none |
| **r** | Manual Refresh | Manually refreshes the emerge status (also exits screensaver mode) |
| **a** | Toggle Auto-refresh | Switches between automatic and manual refresh modes |
| **+** or **=** | Increase Interval | Increases auto-refresh interval by 1 second |
| **-** | Decrease Interval | Decreases auto-refresh interval by 1 second (minimum: 1 second) |
| **q** | Quit | Exits the program |

## üìñ Detailed Feature Guide

### 1. Emerge ETA Monitoring

The main screen displays:
- **Current emerge progress**: Shows which package is being compiled
- **ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)**: Time remaining for current package
- **Overall progress**: If multiple packages are being emerged
- **Compilation details**: Build time estimates based on historical data

**How it works**: The script uses `genlop -c` to query the current emerge status. This requires sudo privileges because genlop needs to read portage logs.

**Example output**:
```
Currently merging 1 out of 3

 * app-editors/vim-9.0.2116

       current merge time: 1 minute and 23 seconds.
       ETA: 2 minutes.
```

### 2. Screensaver Mode

Press **s** to cycle through different screensavers:

#### Available Screensavers:

1. **none** - Default view showing emerge status
2. **pipes.sh** - Animated colorful pipes flowing across your terminal
3. **cmatrix** - Matrix-style cascading characters
4. **hollywood** - Simulates a Hollywood hacker terminal with multiple split windows
5. **asciiquarium** - A beautiful ASCII art aquarium with swimming fish

**Usage**:
- Press **s** to activate the first screensaver
- Press **s** again to cycle to the next screensaver
- Press **r** to return to the main emerge status view

**Note**: Screensavers continue to run while emerge is working in the background. You won't miss any updates!

### 3. Real-time Clock & Timers

The header displays three time-related metrics:

```
Current Time:     2025-10-30 14:32:15
Script Runtime:   00:15:32
Emerge Runtime:   00:42:18
```

- **Current Time**: Your system's current date and time
- **Script Runtime**: How long the emerge-monitor script has been running
- **Emerge Runtime**: How long the current emerge process has been running (detected automatically)

### 4. Auto-refresh vs Manual Refresh

#### Auto-refresh Mode (Default)

- Screen updates automatically every 5 seconds (default)
- Adjust interval using **+** and **-** keys
- Shows "Auto (5 sec)" in the header

#### Manual Refresh Mode

- Screen only updates when you press **r**
- Useful if you want to read the output carefully
- Shows "Manual" in the header
- Toggle with **a** key

### 5. Configurable Refresh Interval

Fine-tune how often the screen updates:

- Press **+** or **=** to increase interval (e.g., 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 7 seconds)
- Press **-** to decrease interval (e.g., 5 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 3 seconds)
- Minimum interval: 1 second
- Maximum interval: unlimited (but who wants to wait that long?)

**Tip**: Increase the interval to reduce CPU usage on older systems.

## üîß Configuration

### Sudo Configuration for Genlop

The script requires sudo access to run `genlop`. To avoid entering your password each time, you can configure sudoers:

1. Edit sudoers file:
   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. Add this line (replace `yourusername` with your actual username):
   ```
   yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/genlop
   ```

3. Save and exit

**Warning**: Only do this if you understand the security implications!

### Customizing the Script

You can edit the script to customize:

- **Default refresh interval**: Change `REFRESH_INTERVAL=5` to your preferred value
- **Color scheme**: Modify the color definitions at the top of the script
- **Screensaver order**: Rearrange the `SCREENSAVERS` array

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "genlop is not installed"

**Solution**: Install genlop:
```bash
sudo emerge app-portage/genlop
```

### "No emerge process currently running"

This is normal if you run the script without an active emerge. The script will still work, but won't show emerge progress. Start an emerge in another terminal:
```bash
sudo emerge --ask some-package
```

### Screensaver not found

**Solution**: Install the missing screensaver (see Optional Dependencies above) or simply skip to the next one by pressing **s** again.

### Screen doesn't refresh automatically

**Possible causes**:
1. Auto-refresh is disabled - Press **a** to enable it
2. You're in screensaver mode - Press **r** to return to main view

### Terminal display issues

**Solution**: Resize your terminal window. The script works best with at least 80 columns width.

## üéì Examples

### Example 1: Monitor a System Update

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start system update
sudo emerge --update --deep --newuse @world

# Terminal 2: Monitor progress
./emerge-monitor.sh
```

### Example 2: Monitor with Screensaver

```bash
# Start the monitor
./emerge-monitor.sh

# Press 's' to activate pipes.sh screensaver
# Watch the pretty pipes while your packages compile
# Press 's' again to switch to cmatrix
# Press 'r' to check emerge progress
```

### Example 3: Custom Refresh Rate

```bash
# Start the monitor
./emerge-monitor.sh

# Press '+' several times to set refresh to 10 seconds
# Perfect for slow terminals or SSH connections
```
